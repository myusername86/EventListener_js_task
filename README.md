i was given below data and i was asked to create table on button click using Java script.

    ["Skanska AB", "Stockholm", 1887],
];

step 1: I have created a button in HTML file and created id for that:

        <button id="createTableButton">Create Table</button>
        
step 2: In my js file created a function for display the table.

        inside the function i have used for loop to iterate over the array

        i have created nested for loop concept here.
step 3: I have created structure of the table using js.by creating elements and added text element.

step4: I have appended content of the table

step 5:Added Event listener for the button click.
